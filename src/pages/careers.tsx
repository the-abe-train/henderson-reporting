The position allowed me to connect with judges and lawyers that no mentorship program could have provided me with, and I was being compensated for doing it. Henderson Reporting and Transcribing Inc. is truly a wonderful place to work for students interested in the legal field.”`,

    quote: `“I worked at Henderson Reporting and Transcribing throughout my undergraduate career, and I am proud to say that this is the best work experience I have had. It is eye-opening for me to witness and participate in the court proceedings that no other jobs or textbooks can teach you. I had the opportunity to connect with judges and lawyers and really understand the law more in-depth. I urge any students who are interested in the legal field to work at Henderson Reporting and Transcribing. We received a great training program before we start. Other seniors were always happy to help newcomers. We have such a great working environment, and the job also gave me the chance to connect with other students who are interested in the same path. More importantly, the management team really cares about their employees. My manager was extremely accommodating to my busy school schedule. Through my time working with Jennifer, I have always felt motivated to work and received immersive support from her. She is also extremely protective of us and gave clear, direct and consistent communication with her employees. I urge any students who are interested in the legal field to join Henderson Reporting. This is the proudest working experience on my resume. The skills I learned from this role and working under Henderson Reporting are applicable to any other fields as well.”`,
